### Run with Docker

To run this project using Docker, make sure you have Docker installed and running on your machine. You can use the Dockerfile or create your own.

1.  **Build the Docker Image**
    
    From the project's root directory, run the following command to build the Docker image. Replace `email-service-backend` with your desired image name.
    
    ```bash
    docker build -t email-service-backend .
    ```
    
2.  **Run the Docker Container**
    
    After the image is built, run the following command to start a container from it. This command maps port `3001` on your local machine to port `3001` inside the container and passes the environment variables from your `.env` file.
    
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 3001:3001 --env-file ./.env --name email-service-container email-service-backend
    ```
